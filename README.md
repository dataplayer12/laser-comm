Interstellar communications with a laser and arduino

## Basic Idea

Powerful laser beams can penetrate the Earth's atmosphere and travel far into space, providing an effective means of communication for hobbyists and space agencies alike. This project is a hobbyist's attempt to explore the current state of the technology required to send signals into space over interstellar distances. Specifically, I am interested in technology which is available to hobbyists, does not require licences or permits to use and costs no more than a hundred US dollars.

It has been established by experiments conducted on International Space Station (ISS) that a 1 Watt blue laser beam sent from the surface of the earth not only reaches space, but is powerful enough to be seen by the naked human eye. See Scott Manley's great video on this:

## Circuit
Communication requires a PCB.
